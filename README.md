## My process

Based on reviews of previous challenges I've made from Frontend Mentor, this time I focused on making my HTML structure a tittle bit cleaner and also add the "alt" texts for the images. 

This challenge is the first one that I make without a Figma design file, so I had to do my build only from my interpretation and understanding of a .png printscreen offered by the Frontend Mentor.

I've used a mix of flex and grid displays through the design, but I admit that I don't fully understand the difference between the two of them. In general, I use what I think it's going to work...

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
